### Welcome to my tic tac toe game

I am making this tic tac toe game as a project to learn about c++ software development

todo:
- fix cmake integration
- add gui on Qt (and other implementations)

Note : After building, qt dlls appear missing.
Copy these dlls from your qt install folder to the bin folder
- Qt5Core.dll
- Qt5Widgets.dll
- Qt5Gui.dll
- platforms/QWindows.dll (with the folder)
